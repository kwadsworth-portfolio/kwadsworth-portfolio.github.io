    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This lab-style project was designed to mirror how a small organisation might
      establish a secure AWS footprint. The goal was to apply cloud security
      principles in a structured way, linking each design choice back to risk,
      governance and operational requirements.
    </p>

  <article class="project-case">
    <h2>2. Scope &amp; Assumptions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Single AWS account representing a small organisation or business unit.</li>
      <li>Mix of internet-facing and internal workloads.</li>
      <li>Focus on core security controls rather than advanced cloud-native services.</li>
      <li>Emphasis on auditability, traceability and least-privilege access.</li>
    </ul>
  </article>

  <article class="project-case">
    <h2>3. Architecture &amp; Design</h2>
    <p>
      I designed a basic but secure reference architecture that can be extended
      over time. Key design elements included:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>VPC with separate public and private subnets.</li>
      <li>Internet-facing resources placed only in public subnets where required.</li>
      <li>Application and data components hosted in private subnets.</li>
      <li>Security groups limiting inbound and outbound traffic based on role.</li>
      <li>Use of IAM roles for services instead of long-lived access keys.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The architecture was documented so that each component could be explained
      back to a non-technical stakeholder in terms of risk reduction and resilience.
    </p>
  </article>

  <article class="project-case">
    <h2>4. Identity &amp; Access Management</h2>
    <p>
      IAM was treated as a core control rather than an afterthought. I:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Defined roles for administrators, developers and read-only users.</li>
      <li>Applied least-privilege policies mapped to specific job functions.</li>
      <li>Used IAM roles for EC2 and services instead of embedding credentials.</li>
      <li>Documented which roles had access to which resources and why.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This allowed me to show how access design links directly to governance and
      audit expectations.
    </p>
  </article>

  <article class="project-case">
    <h2>5. Logging, Monitoring &amp; Evidence</h2>
    <p>
      To support investigation and assurance activities, I:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enabled CloudTrail for account-level activity logging.</li>
      <li>Ensured logs were centralised and retained for review.</li>
      <li>Verified that key events such as console logins and IAM changes were captured.</li>
      <li>Captured screenshots and configuration details as project evidence.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The focus was on being able to demonstrate “who did what, where and when”
      in a way that aligns with audit and incident response requirements.
    </p>

  <article class="project-case">
    <h2>6. Risk-Based Decisions &amp; Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout the build, I noted decisions, trade-offs and residual risks. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Which services were in scope for this phase and which were deferred.</li>
      <li>Where default configurations were acceptable and where hardening was needed.</li>
      <li>What controls would be prioritised in a follow-on phase (e.g. WAF, GuardDuty).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Future enhancements could include integration with a SIEM, automated
      compliance checks and more detailed threat-modelling for critical workloads.
