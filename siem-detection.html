    <h1>SIEM Visibility &amp; Detection Case Study</h1>
    <p>
      Establishing security visibility through log collection, detections and
      a simple incident response workflow, with a focus on linking alerts back
      to business risk and operational impact.

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project focuses on building practical experience with a Security
      Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform. The goal is to move
      from raw log data to meaningful alerts and investigations, using a
      structured, risk-aware approach that mirrors how SOC and security
      teams operate in practice.
    </p>
  </article>

  <article class="project-case">
    <h2>2. Scope &amp; Assumptions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Small set of systems (e.g. one Windows host, one Linux host or lab VMs).</li>
      <li>Focus on authentication, system activity and basic security events.</li>
      <li>Objective is understanding flow: log &rarr; event &rarr; alert &rarr; investigation.</li>
      <li>Assumes a hosted or lab SIEM platform is available for testing.</li>
    </ul>
  </article>

  <article class="project-case">
    <h2>3. Log Sources &amp; Onboarding</h2>
    <p>
      I began by selecting which log sources would add the most value for a
      small environment, then onboarded them into the SIEM:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Authentication logs (logon success/failure, account lockouts).</li>
      <li>System logs for key services and security-relevant events.</li>
      <li>Optional: basic firewall or endpoint security logs if available.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The aim was to ensure that any investigation into a suspicious login or
      system change would have enough supporting detail to be meaningful.
    </p>
  </article>

  <article class="project-case">
    <h2>4. Detections &amp; Use Cases</h2>
    <p>
      I then defined a set of simple but realistic detection use cases, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Multiple failed logins followed by a successful login from the same source.</li>
      <li>Logins outside expected working hours.</li>
      <li>New local user creation on a server or critical host.</li>
      <li>Service or process execution that is unusual for that system role.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For each use case, I created detection rules or queries in the SIEM and
      validated that they would trigger under the right conditions.
    </p>
  </article>

    <h2>5. Dashboards, Triage &amp; Investigation</h2>
    <p>
      To support ongoing monitoring and incident handling, I:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Built simple dashboards to show failed logins, account lockouts and key security events.</li>
      <li>Configured alert views for quick triage.</li>
      <li>Performed test investigations using simulated suspicious activity.</li>
      <li>Documented the steps taken from initial alert through to basic root cause analysis.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This helped connect the technical view (logs and alerts) with the
      operational view (what this means for the organisation).
    </p>
  </article>

  <article class="project-case">
    <h2>6. Incident Workflow &amp; Lessons Learned</h2>
    <p>
      I outlined a lightweight incident handling workflow covering:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Alert review and initial triage.</li>
      <li>Enrichment and gathering of additional context.</li>
      <li>Escalation criteria and potential containment steps.</li>
      <li>Documentation of findings and recommendations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I also captured lessons learned around noise reduction, alert tuning and
      the importance of understanding normal behaviour before defining what is
      “suspicious”.
    </p>
  </article>

  <article class="project-case">
    <h2>7. Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
      Future enhancements to this lab could include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Integrating additional log sources such as cloud platforms or SaaS tools.</li>
      <li>Building more advanced correlation rules across multiple systems.</li>
      <li>Linking detections to a formal playbook or SOAR-style automation.</li>
      <li>Mapping detections to frameworks such as ATT&amp;CK for coverage analysis.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Overall, this project demonstrates how I approach visibility, detection and
      incident handling using a structured and risk-based perspective, rather than
      focusing purely on tooling.
