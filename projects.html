    <h2>Project 1: AWS Cloud Security Fundamentals</h2>
    <p class="project-meta">
      Cloud security initiative focused on identity, access control,
      network segmentation and auditability.
    </p>

    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>
      To design and deploy a secure AWS environment, demonstrating how cloud
      security principles can be applied to reduce risk and support governance
      and compliance requirements.
    </p>

    <h3>What I Implemented</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Secure AWS account setup with foundational security controls.</li>
      <li>IAM users, roles and policies aligned to least-privilege principles.</li>
      <li>VPC design with public and private subnet separation.</li>
      <li>Network access controls using security groups.</li>
      <li>Centralised logging and monitoring to support investigation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Approach &amp; Outcomes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Applied a structured delivery approach: scope, risk identification, control implementation.</li>
      <li>Documented security decisions and residual risks.</li>
      <li>Produced artefacts suitable for walkthroughs and interviews.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Project 2: SIEM Visibility &amp; Incident Detection</h2>
    <p class="project-meta">
      Security monitoring and detection initiative focused on event visibility
      and response workflows.
    </p>

    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>
      To establish security visibility through log collection and demonstrate
      how raw events become actionable alerts within a SIEM.
    </p>

    <h3>What I Implemented</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Connected systems to a SIEM for log ingestion.</li>
      <li>Created detection rules for suspicious authentication activity.</li>
      <li>Built dashboards to highlight trends and anomalies.</li>
      <li>Performed basic alert triage and investigation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Approach &amp; Outcomes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Mapped detections to common attack behaviours.</li>
      <li>Demonstrated the link between technical alerts and business risk.</li>
      <li>Documented findings and limitations of detection coverage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Project 3: Cyber GRC &amp; Risk Management (Mini-ISMS)</h2>
    <p class="project-meta">
      Governance, risk and compliance initiative aligned to ISO 27001 principles.
    </p>

    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>
      To design a lightweight Information Security Management System (ISMS)
      demonstrating how governance and risk management support effective
      security decision-making.
    </p>

    <h3>What I Implemented</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Asset identification and data classification.</li>
      <li>Risk register capturing threats, likelihood and impact.</li>
      <li>Selection of appropriate security controls.</li>
      <li>Drafted core security policies and procedures.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Approach &amp; Outcomes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensured traceability between risks, controls and governance objectives.</li>
      <li>Applied project discipline to structure documentation and reviews.</li>
      <li>Created a practical foundation suitable for a small organisation.</li>
    </ul>
