  <!-- PROJECT 1 -->
  <article class="project-case">
    <h2>Project 1: AWS Cloud Security Fundamentals Lab</h2>
    <p class="project-meta">
      Cybersecurity and cloud security initiative designed around real-world
      use cases, focusing on identity, access control, network segmentation
      and auditability.
    </p>

    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>
      To design and deploy a secure AWS environment and demonstrate how identity
      management, access control, network separation and logging can be combined
      to reduce risk and support governance requirements.
    </p>

    <h3>What I Implemented</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Created an AWS environment with security guardrails and account protections enabled.</li>
      <li>Configured IAM users, roles and policies following least-privilege principles.</li>
      <li>Designed a VPC with public and private subnets to separate internet-facing and internal resources.</li>
      <li>Restricted access using security groups and network controls aligned to defined use cases.</li>
      <li>Enabled CloudTrail and basic monitoring to support auditability and incident investigation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Approach &amp; Outcomes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Applied a structured, project-style approach: scoped the environment, identified risks, then implemented controls.</li>
      <li>Documented security decisions, assumptions and residual risks for future review.</li>
      <li>Produced architecture diagrams and configuration evidence suitable for walkthroughs or interviews.</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- PROJECT 2 -->
  <article class="project-case">
    <h2>Project 2: SIEM Visibility &amp; Detection Lab</h2>
    <p class="project-meta">
      Security monitoring and detection initiative based on real-world event and
      alert use cases, focused on visibility, investigation and informed response.
    </p>

    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>
      To establish security visibility using a SIEM platform and demonstrate how
      events move from raw logs to meaningful alerts that can support an incident
      response workflow.
    </p>

    <h3>What I Implemented</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Onboarded test systems to a SIEM to collect authentication and system activity logs.</li>
      <li>Created detection rules for suspicious activity such as repeated failed logins and unusual process execution.</li>
      <li>Built simple dashboards to visualise trends and highlight notable events.</li>
      <li>Defined a basic workflow from alert triage through to investigation and response.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Approach &amp; Outcomes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Mapped detections to common attack behaviours to understand coverage and gaps.</li>
      <li>Captured example alerts and investigations to demonstrate practical understanding of SIEM usage.</li>
      <li>Used the lab to connect technical events back to business impact and risk.</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- PROJECT 3 -->
  <article class="project-case">
    <h2>Project 3: Cyber GRC &amp; Risk Management Mini-ISMS</h2>
    <p class="project-meta">
      Governance, risk and compliance initiative designed to reflect real-world
      organisational risk contexts, control selection and assurance requirements.
    </p>

    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>
      To design a lightweight Information Security Management System (ISMS) for a
      fictional organisation and demonstrate how governance, risk management and
      security controls can be aligned with business objectives.
    </p>

    <h3>What I Implemented</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Defined a simple asset inventory and data classification approach.</li>
      <li>Built a risk register capturing threats, likelihood, impact and treatment decisions.</li>
      <li>Drafted core information security policies (e.g. access control, incident management, acceptable use).</li>
      <li>Mapped identified risks to appropriate security controls and documented rationale.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Approach &amp; Outcomes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Applied project management discipline to structure the ISMS: scope, requirements, artefacts and review.</li>
      <li>Emphasised traceability from business risks through to chosen technical and procedural controls.</li>
      <li>Produced documentation suitable as a starting point for a small-organisation ISMS.</li>
    </ul>
