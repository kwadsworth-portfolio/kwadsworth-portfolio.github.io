    <h1>Project 3: Cyber GRC &amp; Risk Management (Mini-ISMS)</h1>
    <p>
      Governance, risk and compliance initiative aligned to ISO&nbsp;27001 principles,
      demonstrating how a lightweight ISMS and structured risk management can support
      better security decision-making for a small organisation.

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project focused on designing a lightweight Information Security Management
      System (ISMS) and risk management approach suitable for a small organisation.
      The aim was to demonstrate how governance, risk and control can be applied in a
      practical way without the overhead of a full enterprise-scale implementation.

    <h2>2. Scope &amp; Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Establish a simple but robust cyber GRC framework aligned to ISO&nbsp;27001 principles.</li>
      <li>Create a risk register that links threats, likelihood, impact and ownership.</li>
      <li>Define proportionate security controls mapped directly to identified risks.</li>
      <li>Produce clear governance documentation (roles, reviews, responsibilities).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. ISMS &amp; Risk Design</h2>
    <p>
      I designed a mini-ISMS that could realistically be adopted by a small business.
      Key design elements included:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Asset identification and simple data classification based on business impact.</li>
      <li>Risk register structure covering threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood and impact.</li>
      <li>Risk scoring model to support prioritisation and treatment decisions.</li>
      <li>Controls mapped to risks using ISO&nbsp;27001 style control categories.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The emphasis was on traceability &mdash; showing exactly how each control helped reduce
      specific risks and support business objectives.

    <h2>4. Governance, Policies &amp; Procedures</h2>
    <p>
      Governance was treated as a core pillar rather than an afterthought. I:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Defined roles and responsibilities for risk ownership and approval.</li>
      <li>Drafted core ISMS policies (access control, incident management, backup, acceptable use).</li>
      <li>Outlined a simple review cadence for risks, controls and policy effectiveness.</li>
      <li>Documented how exceptions and residual risks would be recorded and justified.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This allowed me to demonstrate how GRC practices support auditability and accountability.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Outcomes &amp; Lessons Learned</h2>
    <p>
      The project delivered a practical GRC and risk management foundation that can be
      extended over time. Key outcomes included:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clear linkage between business objectives, risks and mitigating controls.</li>
      <li>Improved visibility of security risks for stakeholders and decision-makers.</li>
      <li>A repeatable framework that can be scaled as the organisation grows.</li>
      <li>Better understanding of how ISO&nbsp;27001-style governance works in practice.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Future enhancements could include integration with tooling (e.g. GRC platforms,
      ticketing, SIEM) and more formalised metrics and reporting.
