    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Experienced Project Manager transitioning into cybersecurity, applying
      established delivery, risk, governance and compliance capability within
      a security-focused context.

<main class="main-section about-content">
  <p>
    I am an experienced Project Manager with a background in delivering complex,
    high-value infrastructure and technology projects. Over my career, I have
    worked across planning, risk management, governance, stakeholder engagement
    and delivery assurance within highly regulated and operationally critical
    environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through this experience, I developed a strong interest in cybersecurity —
    particularly how security controls, risk management and governance frameworks
    underpin safe, resilient and compliant systems. This interest has led me to
    focus my career on cybersecurity, cloud security and GRC.
  </p>

  <p>
    Rather than approaching cybersecurity purely from a theoretical perspective,
    I am building practical capability through structured labs and projects that
    cover:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Cloud security fundamentals across AWS and Azure.</li>
    <li>Security logging, monitoring and basic detection using SIEM platforms.</li>
    <li>Cyber risk management, governance and ISO 27001-style controls.</li>
    <li>Security-focused automation using Python.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    My project management background provides strong transferable skills that are
    directly relevant to cybersecurity and GRC roles, including structured
    problem-solving, risk-based decision making, documentation, stakeholder
    communication and the ability to work methodically within defined frameworks.
  </p>

  <p>
    This portfolio documents my transition into cybersecurity and demonstrates
    both my existing professional experience and my commitment to continuous
    learning. My objective is to work in roles such as GRC analyst/manager,
    cyber project/programme manager or information security manager, where I
    can combine delivery discipline with security-focused thinking.
