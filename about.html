    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Experienced Project Manager transitioning into cybersecurity, applying
      delivery discipline, risk management and governance capability within
      security-focused roles.

<main class="main-section about-content">

  <p>
    I am an experienced Project Manager with a background in delivering complex,
    high-value infrastructure and technology projects within highly regulated
    environments. My work has involved planning, governance, stakeholder
    engagement, risk management and delivery assurance.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through this experience, I developed a strong interest in cybersecurity
    particularly how security controls, governance frameworks and risk
    management underpin resilient and compliant systems. This has driven a
    deliberate transition into cybersecurity, cloud security and GRC.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am building practical cybersecurity capability through structured projects
    that reflect real-world operational use cases, including:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Cloud security design across AWS and Azure.</li>
    <li>Security logging, monitoring and SIEM-based detection.</li>
    <li>Cyber risk management and ISO 27001-aligned governance.</li>
    <li>Security-focused automation using Python.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    My project management background provides strong transferable skills directly
    relevant to cybersecurity and GRC roles, including analytical problem-solving,
    risk-based decision making, documentation, communication and structured
    delivery.
  </p>

  <p>
    This portfolio demonstrates my transition into cybersecurity and my
    commitment to developing strong technical foundations while applying
    established professional experience. I am targeting roles such as
    GRC analyst or manager, cyber project or programme manager, and information
    security management positions.
